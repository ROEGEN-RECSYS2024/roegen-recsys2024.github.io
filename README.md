## Home

Generative models are changing the way we seek information online. Large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT represent one successful application of generative models, leveraging vast amounts of texts encoded in their billion-scale parameters. Recommendation systems employing generative models go beyond LLMs, encompassing a broader range of models such as deep generative models (DGMs) trained directly on user-item interactions, multi-modal foundation models, and other non-LLM generative models. These models offer new opportunities in the field of recommender systems by enhancing how user preferences are learned, connecting us with vast amounts of information available on the Internet. They are capable of delivering more personalized and contextually relevant content, generating recommendations without reliance on narrowly defined datasets, and addressing the cold-start issue. Furthermore, these models significantly enhance the level of interactivity users have with recommender systems, boosting conversational capabilities.

However, there is no “free cake”; new advantages bring new challenges and risks that must be addressed when using LLMs and other categories of DGMs. Some of these challenges are new (e.g., hallucination, out-of-inventory recommendations) and some are newly intensified due to the expanded capabilities of these systems (privacy, fairness and biases, security and robustness, manipulation, opacity, accountability, over-reliance on automation). A critical aspect of utilizing these technologies is to develop robust evaluation systems that can effectively assess the performance, fairness, and security of these Gen-RecSys. Proper evaluation is essential to ensure these systems are reliable and trustworthy, especially when dealing with sensitive user data and making impactful recommendations.

This workshop will specifically focus on the **Risks**, **Opportunities**, and **Evaluation** in real-world Recommender System applications, aiming to cover a full spectrum of current challenges and advances. Additionally, the workshop invites discussions on the application of LLMs and Generative Models in specific tasks and areas such as Conversation, Explanation, Bundle Recommendation, among others. The discussions are encouraged as long as the goal pertains to some form of information seeking.

## Topics

This workshop will focus on the opportunities and challenges of Recommender Systems in real-world applications, structured around three key pillars: opportunities, risks and challenges, and evaluation and mitigation strategies. Discussions will cover topics such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, fairness, debiasing, cold-start problems, model distillation, and user interaction design. We also welcome stories of Recommender System usage in specific applications, such as E-commerce, Streaming Services, News, Social Media, and Personalized Marketing. The goal is to bring together industry and academia researchers to foster knowledge sharing and create discussions that pave the way to societally beneficial exploitation of this technology.

### Opportunities

- Integrating large language models and other (multimodal) pre-trained generative models to enhance recommender algorithms for user modeling.
- Generative recommendation using AI to help create personalized item content, such as advertisements, images, and micro-videos.
- Combining content generation and retrieval for personalized information seeking and presentation.
- Leveraging the advantages of generative models to improve traditional recommender tasks, including collaborative, sequential, cold-start, social, conversational, multimodal, and causal recommendation.
- Applications of generative model-enhanced recommender systems in various sectors, such as finance, streaming platforms, social networks, entertainment, music, e-commerce, education, fashion, and healthcare.

### Risks and Challenges

- Identifying and addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with deploying generative models in recommender systems.
- Challenges of hallucination and misinformation risks, particularly with the advent of sophisticated image generation models.
- Examining bias and fairness in models with a special emphasis on mitigating biases related to race, gender, or brands.
- Privacy implications of utilizing extensive data for model training.
- Technical challenges in achieving transparency, explainability, security challenges, accountability and user control in recommendations.
- Ensuring compliance with emerging ethical and legal standards.

### Evaluation and Mitigation

- Developing new benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and protocols to assess the efficacy, fairness, and security of generative models in recommender systems.
- Novel strategies for bias detection, measurement, and understanding.
- Red-teaming and ensuring recommendations are transparent, explainable, and safeguard user privacy.
- Evaluating the robustness, trustworthiness, and real-time performance of generative models across different domains and modalities.
- Designing evaluation methodologies to examine the usage of generative models in recommender systems, including human evaluation paradigms and interfaces.
- Novel approaches for (generative model) Alignment and RLHF for recommendation tasks.
